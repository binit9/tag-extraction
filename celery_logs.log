We have integrated SDK in our Platform that is designed to measure and analyze television  channel viewership of Hotstar Users ("TV SDK").    The TV SDK initiated after obtaining relevant permissions, uses the microphone on your  device to capture audio samples (including ambient sounds) and create encrypted  fingerprint files of such audio samples in real-time. The fingerprint files are matched against  a database of known fingerprints of television channels and television content to identify  and understand your television viewership patterns. The fingerprint files cannot be reverse  engineered into audio samples and are stored on your devices for a period not more than  48 hours. No actual audio samples or voices including conversations that you may have will  be saved on your device or transferred, at any point of time during the fingerprinting  process.    You may consent to the Platform accessing your device microphone and recording functions  for the fingerprinting process, as and when the pop-up appears on your device screen  requesting your explicit consent. You may at any time deny such consent on the consent  pop-up that appears from time to time or by disabling the microphone functionality on your  device. Should you require assistance to revoke your consent earlier given, please contact  us at our coordinates given towards the end of these Terms of Use.

We have integrated SDK in our Platform that is designed to measure and analyze television channel viewership of Hotstar Users ("TV SDK").  The TV SDK initiated after obtaining relevant permissions, uses the microphone on your device to capture audio samples (including ambient sounds) and create encrypted fingerprint files of such audio samples in real-time. The fingerprint files are matched against a database of known fingerprints of television channels and television content to identify and understand your television viewership patterns. The fingerprint files cannot be reverse engineered into audio samples and are stored on your devices for a period not more than 48 hours. No actual audio samples or voices including conversations that you may have will be saved on your device or transferred, at any point of time during the fingerprinting process.  You may consent to the Platform accessing your device microphone and recording functions for the fingerprinting process, as and when the pop-up appears on your device screen requesting your explicit consent. You may at any time deny such consent on the consent pop-up that appears from time to time or by disabling the microphone functionality on your device. Should you require assistance to revoke your consent earlier given, please contact us at our coordinates given towards the end of these Terms of Use.

We have integrated SDK in our Platform that is designed to measure and analyze television channel viewership of Hotstar Users ("TV SDK").  The TV SDK initiated after obtaining relevant permissions, uses the microphone on your device to capture audio samples (including ambient sounds) and create encrypted fingerprint files of such audio samples in real-time. The fingerprint files are matched against a database of known fingerprints of television channels and television content to identify and understand your television viewership patterns. The fingerprint files cannot be reverse engineered into audio samples and are stored on your devices for a period not more than 48 hours. No actual audio samples or voices including conversations that you may have will be saved on your device or transferred, at any point of time during the fingerprinting process.  You may consent to the Platform accessing your device microphone and recording functions for the fingerprinting process, as and when the pop-up appears on your device screen requesting your explicit consent. You may at any time deny such consent on the consent pop-up that appears from time to time or by disabling the microphone functionality on your device. Should you require assistance to revoke your consent earlier given, please contact us at our coordinates given towards the end of these Terms of Use.

We have integrated SDK in our Platform that is designed to measure and analyze television channel viewership of Hotstar Users ("TV SDK").  The TV SDK initiated after obtaining relevant permissions, uses the microphone on your device to capture audio samples (including ambient sounds) and create encrypted fingerprint files of such audio samples in real-time. The fingerprint files are matched against a database of known fingerprints of television channels and television content to identify and understand your television viewership patterns. The fingerprint files cannot be reverse engineered into audio samples and are stored on your devices for a period not more than 48 hours. No actual audio samples or voices including conversations that you may have will be saved on your device or transferred, at any point of time during the fingerprinting process.  You may consent to the Platform accessing your device microphone and recording functions for the fingerprinting process, as and when the pop-up appears on your device screen requesting your explicit consent. You may at any time deny such consent on the consent pop-up that appears from time to time or by disabling the microphone functionality on your device. Should you require assistance to revoke your consent earlier given, please contact us at our coordinates given towards the end of these Terms of Use.

We have integrated SDK in our Platform that is designed to measure and analyze television channel viewership of Hotstar Users ("TV SDK").  The TV SDK initiated after obtaining relevant permissions, uses the microphone on your device to capture audio samples (including ambient sounds) and create encrypted fingerprint files of such audio samples in real-time. The fingerprint files are matched against a database of known fingerprints of television channels and television content to identify and understand your television viewership patterns. The fingerprint files cannot be reverse engineered into audio samples and are stored on your devices for a period not more than 48 hours. No actual audio samples or voices including conversations that you may have will be saved on your device or transferred, at any point of time during the fingerprinting process.  You may consent to the Platform accessing your device microphone and recording functions for the fingerprinting process, as and when the pop-up appears on your device screen requesting your explicit consent. You may at any time deny such consent on the consent pop-up that appears from time to time or by disabling the microphone functionality on your device. Should you require assistance to revoke your consent earlier given, please contact us at our coordinates given towards the end of these Terms of Use.

We have integrated SDK in our Platform that is designed to measure and analyze television channel viewership of Hotstar Users ("TV SDK").  The TV SDK initiated after obtaining relevant permissions, uses the microphone on your device to capture audio samples (including ambient sounds) and create encrypted fingerprint files of such audio samples in real-time. The fingerprint files are matched against a database of known fingerprints of television channels and television content to identify and understand your television viewership patterns. The fingerprint files cannot be reverse engineered into audio samples and are stored on your devices for a period not more than 48 hours. No actual audio samples or voices including conversations that you may have will be saved on your device or transferred, at any point of time during the fingerprinting process.  You may consent to the Platform accessing your device microphone and recording functions for the fingerprinting process, as and when the pop-up appears on your device screen requesting your explicit consent. You may at any time deny such consent on the consent pop-up that appears from time to time or by disabling the microphone functionality on your device. Should you require assistance to revoke your consent earlier given, please contact us at our coordinates given towards the end of these Terms of Use.

We have integrated SDK in our Platform that is designed to measure and analyze television channel viewership of Hotstar Users ("TV SDK").  The TV SDK initiated after obtaining relevant permissions, uses the microphone on your device to capture audio samples (including ambient sounds) and create encrypted fingerprint files of such audio samples in real-time. The fingerprint files are matched against a database of known fingerprints of television channels and television content to identify and understand your television viewership patterns. The fingerprint files cannot be reverse engineered into audio samples and are stored on your devices for a period not more than 48 hours. No actual audio samples or voices including conversations that you may have will be saved on your device or transferred, at any point of time during the fingerprinting process.  You may consent to the Platform accessing your device microphone and recording functions for the fingerprinting process, as and when the pop-up appears on your device screen requesting your explicit consent. You may at any time deny such consent on the consent pop-up that appears from time to time or by disabling the microphone functionality on your device. Should you require assistance to revoke your consent earlier given, please contact us at our coordinates given towards the end of these Terms of Use.

We have integrated SDK in our Platform that is designed to measure and analyze television channel viewership of Hotstar Users ("TV SDK").  The TV SDK initiated after obtaining relevant permissions, uses the microphone on your device to capture audio samples (including ambient sounds) and create encrypted fingerprint files of such audio samples in real-time. The fingerprint files are matched against a database of known fingerprints of television channels and television content to identify and understand your television viewership patterns. The fingerprint files cannot be reverse engineered into audio samples and are stored on your devices for a period not more than 48 hours. No actual audio samples or voices including conversations that you may have will be saved on your device or transferred, at any point of time during the fingerprinting process.  You may consent to the Platform accessing your device microphone and recording functions for the fingerprinting process, as and when the pop-up appears on your device screen requesting your explicit consent. You may at any time deny such consent on the consent pop-up that appears from time to time or by disabling the microphone functionality on your device. Should you require assistance to revoke your consent earlier given, please contact us at our coordinates given towards the end of these Terms of Use.

We have integrated SDK in our Platform that is designed to measure and analyze television channel viewership of Hotstar Users ("TV SDK").  The TV SDK initiated after obtaining relevant permissions, uses the microphone on your device to capture audio samples (including ambient sounds) and create encrypted fingerprint files of such audio samples in real-time. The fingerprint files are matched against a database of known fingerprints of television channels and television content to identify and understand your television viewership patterns. The fingerprint files cannot be reverse engineered into audio samples and are stored on your devices for a period not more than 48 hours. No actual audio samples or voices including conversations that you may have will be saved on your device or transferred, at any point of time during the fingerprinting process.  You may consent to the Platform accessing your device microphone and recording functions for the fingerprinting process, as and when the pop-up appears on your device screen requesting your explicit consent. You may at any time deny such consent on the consent pop-up that appears from time to time or by disabling the microphone functionality on your device. Should you require assistance to revoke your consent earlier given, please contact us at our coordinates given towards the end of these Terms of Use.

[2019-04-01 11:47:15,391: WARNING/ForkPoolWorker-3] PLATFORM IN-BUILT FEATURES    We may collect your television viewership data and use it along with other information that  you provide us on the Platform, including any Personal Information, for the purposes set out  in this Privacy Policy i.e. to provide you with better and personalised content,  advertisements and suitable recommendations.    We have integrated SDK in our Platform that is designed to measure and analyze television  channel viewership of Hotstar Users ("TV SDK").    The TV SDK initiated after obtaining relevant permissions, uses the microphone on your  device to capture audio samples (including ambient sounds) and create encrypted  fingerprint files of such audio samples in real-time. The fingerprint files are matched against  a database of known fingerprints of television channels and television content to identify  and understand your television viewership patterns. The fingerprint files cannot be reverse  engineered into audio samples and are stored on your devices for a period not more than  48 hours. No actual audio samples or voices including conversations that you may have will  be saved on your device or transferred, at any point of time during the fingerprinting  process.    You may consent to the Platform accessing your device microphone and recording functions  for the fingerprinting process, as and when the pop-up appears on your device screen  requesting your explicit consent. You may at any time deny such consent on the consent  pop-up that appears from time to time or by disabling the microphone functionality on your  device. Should you require assistance to revoke your consent earlier given, please contact  us at our coordinates given towards the end of these Terms of Use.

The fingerprint files cannot be reverse engineered into audio samples and are stored on your devices for a period not more than 48 hours. No actual audio samples or voices including conversations that you may have will be saved on your device or transferred, at any point of time during the fingerprinting process.  You may consent to the Platform accessing your device microphone and recording functions for the fingerprinting process, as and when the pop-up appears on your device screen requesting your explicit consent. You may at any time deny such consent on the consent pop-up that appears from time to time or by disabling the microphone functionality on your device.

[2019-04-01 11:59:56,514: WARNING/ForkPoolWorker-1] Collection and Use of Personal Information Personal information is data that can be used to identify or contact a single person. You may be asked to provide your personal information anytime you are in contact with Apple or an Apple affiliated company. Apple and its affiliates may share this personal information with each other and use it consistent with this Privacy Policy. They may also combine it with other information to provide and improve our products, services, content, and advertising. You are not required to provide the personal information that we have requested, but, if you chose not to do so, in many cases we will not be able to provide you with our products or services or respond to any queries you may have. Here are some examples of the types of personal information Apple may collect and how we may use it  What personal information we collect When you create an Apple ID, apply for commercial credit, purchase a product, download a software update, register for a class at an Apple Retail Store, connect to our services, contact us or participate in an online survey, we may collect a variety of information, including your name, mailing address, phone number, email address, contact preferences, device identifiers, IP address, location information and credit card information. When you share your content with family and friends using Apple products, send gift certificates and products, or invite others to participate in Apple services or forums, Apple may collect the information you provide about those people such as name, mailing address, email address, and phone number. Apple will use such information to fulfill your requests, provide the relevant product or service, or for anti-fraud purposes. In certain jurisdictions, we may ask for a government issued ID in limited circumstances including when setting up a wireless account and activating your device, for the purpose of extending commercial credit, managing reservations, or as required by law. How we use your personal information We may process your personal information  for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, with your consent, for compliance with a legal obligation to which Apple is subject or when we have assessed it is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by Apple or a third party to whom it may be necessary to disclose information. The personal information we collect allows us to keep you posted on Apple s latest product announcements, software updates, and upcoming events. If you don t want to be on our mailing list, you can opt out anytime by updating your preferences. We also use personal information to help us create, develop, operate, deliver, and improve our products, services, content and advertising, and for loss prevention and anti-fraud purposes. We may also use your personal information for account and network security purposes, including in order to protect our services for the benefit of all our users. Where we use your information for anti-fraud purposes it arises from the conduct of an online transaction with us. We limit our uses of data for anti-fraud purposes to those which are strictly necessary and within our assessed legitimate interests to protect our customers and our services. For certain online transactions we may also validate the information provided by you with publicly accessible sources. We may use your personal information, including date of birth, to verify identity, assist with identification of users, and to determine appropriate services. For example, we may use date of birth to determine the age of Apple ID account holders. From time to time, we may use your personal information to send important notices, such as communications about purchases and changes to our terms, conditions, and policies. Because this information is important to your interaction with Apple, you may not opt out of receiving these communications. We may also use personal information for internal purposes such as auditing, data analysis, and research to improve Apple s products, services, and customer communications. If you enter into a sweepstake, contest, or similar promotion we may use the information you provide to administer those programs. Source of your personal information where they are not collected from you We may have received your personal information from other persons if that person has shared their content with you using Apple products, sent gift certificates and products, or invited you to participate in Apple services or forums. We may also validate the information provided by you when creating an Apple ID with a third party for security and fraud prevention purposes. For research and development purposes, we may use datasets such as those that contain images, voices or other data that could be associated with an identifiable person. When acquiring such datasets, we do so in accordance with applicable law in the jurisdiction in which the dataset is hosted. When using such datasets for research and development, we do not attempt to re-identify individuals who may appear therein.

[2019-04-01 11:59:56,642: WARNING/ForkPoolWorker-1] Cookies and Other Technologies Apple s websites, online services, interactive applications, email messages, and advertisements may use "cookies" and other technologies such as pixel tags and web beacons. These technologies help us better understand user behavior, tell us which parts of our websites people have visited, and facilitate and measure the effectiveness of advertisements and web searches. We treat information collected by cookies and other technologies as nonpersonal information. However, to the extent that Internet Protocol (IP) addresses or similar identifiers are considered personal information by local law, we also treat these identifiers as personal information. Similarly, to the extent that non-personal information is combined with personal information, we treat the combined information as personal information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy. Ads that are delivered by Apple s advertising platform may appear in Apple News and in the App Store. If you do not wish to receive ads targeted to your interests from Apple's advertising platform, you can choose to enable Limit Ad Tracking, which will opt your Apple ID out of receiving such ads regardless of what device you are using. If you enable Limit AdTracking on your mobile device, third-party apps cannot use the Advertising Identifier, a non-personal device identifier, to serve you targeted ads. You may still see ads in the App Store or News based on context like your search query or the channel you are reading. In third-party apps, you may see ads based on other information. Apple and our partners also use cookies and other technologies to remember personal information when you use our website, online services, and applications. Our goal in these cases is to make your experience with Apple more convenient and personal. For example, knowing your first name lets us welcome you the next time you visit the Apple Online Store. Knowing your country and language   and if you are an educator, your school   helps us provide a customized and more useful shopping experience. Knowing someone using your computer or device has shopped for a certain product or used a particular service helps us make our advertising and email communications more relevant to your interests. And knowing your contact information, hardware identifiers, and information about your computer or device helps us personalize your operating system, set up your iCloud service, and provide you with better customer service. If you want to disable cookies and you re using the Safari web browser, go to Safari preferences and then to the privacy pane to manage your preferences. On your Apple mobile device, go to Settings, then Safari, scroll down to the Privacy & Security section, and tap on  Block Cookies  to manage your preferences. For other browsers, check with your provider to find out how to disable cookies. Please note that certain features of the Apple website will not be available once cookies are disabled. As is true of most internet services, we gather some information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type and language, Internet service provider (ISP), referring and exit websites and applications, operating system, date time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information to understand and analyze trends, to administer the site, to learn about user behavior on the site, to improve our product and services, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. Apple may use this information in our marketing and advertising services. In some of our email messages, we use a  click-through URL  linked to content on the Apple website. When customers click one of these URLs, they pass through a separate web server before arriving at the destination page on our website. We track this click-through data to help us determine interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our customer communications. If you prefer not to be tracked in this way, you should not click text or graphic links in the email messages. Pixel tags enable us to send email messages in a format customers can read, and they tell us whether mail has been opened. We may use this information to reduce or eliminate messages sent to customers.

Children under the age of 13, or equivalent minimum age in the relevant jurisdiction, are not permitted to create their own Apple IDs, unless their parent provided verifiable consent or as part of the child account creation process in Family Sharing or they have obtained a Managed Apple ID account (where available) through their school. For example, a parent must review the Apple ID and Family Sharing Disclosure and agree to the Consent to Apple s Collection, Use and Disclosure of Your Child s Information  and the iTunes Store Terms and Conditions, before they can begin the Apple ID account creation process for their child. In addition, schools that participate in Apple School Manager and have reviewed and consented to the Managed Apple IDs for Students Disclosure may create Managed Apple IDs for students. The Managed Apple IDs for Students Disclosure describes how Apple handles student information and supplements Apple s Privacy Policy. Learn more about Family Sharing, the Managed Apple IDs and Restrictions for children s accounts. If we learn that we have collected the personal information of a child under 13, or equivalent minimum age depending on jurisdiction, outside the above circumstances we will take steps to delete the information as soon as possible. If at any time a parent needs to access, correct, or delete data associated with their Family Sharing account or child s Apple ID, they may contact us through one of the options provided at the bottom of this page.

[2019-04-01 12:01:00,347: WARNING/ForkPoolWorker-1] Collection and Use of Personal Information Personal information is data that can be used to identify or contact a single person. You may be asked to provide your personal information anytime you are in contact with Apple or an Apple affiliated company. Apple and its affiliates may share this personal information with each other and use it consistent with this Privacy Policy. They may also combine it with other information to provide and improve our products, services, content, and advertising. You are not required to provide the personal information that we have requested, but, if you chose not to do so, in many cases we will not be able to provide you with our products or services or respond to any queries you may have. Here are some examples of the types of personal information Apple may collect and how we may use it  What personal information we collect When you create an Apple ID, apply for commercial credit, purchase a product, download a software update, register for a class at an Apple Retail Store, connect to our services, contact us or participate in an online survey, we may collect a variety of information, including your name, mailing address, phone number, email address, contact preferences, device identifiers, IP address, location information and credit card information. When you share your content with family and friends using Apple products, send gift certificates and products, or invite others to participate in Apple services or forums, Apple may collect the information you provide about those people such as name, mailing address, email address, and phone number. Apple will use such information to fulfill your requests, provide the relevant product or service, or for anti-fraud purposes. In certain jurisdictions, we may ask for a government issued ID in limited circumstances including when setting up a wireless account and activating your device, for the purpose of extending commercial credit, managing reservations, or as required by law. How we use your personal information We may process your personal information  for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, with your consent, for compliance with a legal obligation to which Apple is subject or when we have assessed it is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by Apple or a third party to whom it may be necessary to disclose information. The personal information we collect allows us to keep you posted on Apple s latest product announcements, software updates, and upcoming events. If you don t want to be on our mailing list, you can opt out anytime by updating your preferences. We also use personal information to help us create, develop, operate, deliver, and improve our products, services, content and advertising, and for loss prevention and anti-fraud purposes. We may also use your personal information for account and network security purposes, including in order to protect our services for the benefit of all our users. Where we use your information for anti-fraud purposes it arises from the conduct of an online transaction with us. We limit our uses of data for anti-fraud purposes to those which are strictly necessary and within our assessed legitimate interests to protect our customers and our services. For certain online transactions we may also validate the information provided by you with publicly accessible sources. We may use your personal information, including date of birth, to verify identity, assist with identification of users, and to determine appropriate services. For example, we may use date of birth to determine the age of Apple ID account holders. From time to time, we may use your personal information to send important notices, such as communications about purchases and changes to our terms, conditions, and policies. Because this information is important to your interaction with Apple, you may not opt out of receiving these communications. We may also use personal information for internal purposes such as auditing, data analysis, and research to improve Apple s products, services, and customer communications. If you enter into a sweepstake, contest, or similar promotion we may use the information you provide to administer those programs. Source of your personal information where they are not collected from you We may have received your personal information from other persons if that person has shared their content with you using Apple products, sent gift certificates and products, or invited you to participate in Apple services or forums. We may also validate the information provided by you when creating an Apple ID with a third party for security and fraud prevention purposes. For research and development purposes, we may use datasets such as those that contain images, voices or other data that could be associated with an identifiable person. When acquiring such datasets, we do so in accordance with applicable law in the jurisdiction in which the dataset is hosted. When using such datasets for research and development, we do not attempt to re-identify individuals who may appear therein.

[2019-04-01 12:01:00,474: WARNING/ForkPoolWorker-1] Cookies and Other Technologies Apple s websites, online services, interactive applications, email messages, and advertisements may use "cookies" and other technologies such as pixel tags and web beacons. These technologies help us better understand user behavior, tell us which parts of our websites people have visited, and facilitate and measure the effectiveness of advertisements and web searches. We treat information collected by cookies and other technologies as nonpersonal information. However, to the extent that Internet Protocol (IP) addresses or similar identifiers are considered personal information by local law, we also treat these identifiers as personal information. Similarly, to the extent that non-personal information is combined with personal information, we treat the combined information as personal information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy. Ads that are delivered by Apple s advertising platform may appear in Apple News and in the App Store. If you do not wish to receive ads targeted to your interests from Apple's advertising platform, you can choose to enable Limit Ad Tracking, which will opt your Apple ID out of receiving such ads regardless of what device you are using. If you enable Limit AdTracking on your mobile device, third-party apps cannot use the Advertising Identifier, a non-personal device identifier, to serve you targeted ads. You may still see ads in the App Store or News based on context like your search query or the channel you are reading. In third-party apps, you may see ads based on other information. Apple and our partners also use cookies and other technologies to remember personal information when you use our website, online services, and applications. Our goal in these cases is to make your experience with Apple more convenient and personal. For example, knowing your first name lets us welcome you the next time you visit the Apple Online Store. Knowing your country and language   and if you are an educator, your school   helps us provide a customized and more useful shopping experience. Knowing someone using your computer or device has shopped for a certain product or used a particular service helps us make our advertising and email communications more relevant to your interests. And knowing your contact information, hardware identifiers, and information about your computer or device helps us personalize your operating system, set up your iCloud service, and provide you with better customer service. If you want to disable cookies and you re using the Safari web browser, go to Safari preferences and then to the privacy pane to manage your preferences. On your Apple mobile device, go to Settings, then Safari, scroll down to the Privacy & Security section, and tap on  Block Cookies  to manage your preferences. For other browsers, check with your provider to find out how to disable cookies. Please note that certain features of the Apple website will not be available once cookies are disabled. As is true of most internet services, we gather some information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type and language, Internet service provider (ISP), referring and exit websites and applications, operating system, date time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information to understand and analyze trends, to administer the site, to learn about user behavior on the site, to improve our product and services, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. Apple may use this information in our marketing and advertising services. In some of our email messages, we use a  click-through URL  linked to content on the Apple website. When customers click one of these URLs, they pass through a separate web server before arriving at the destination page on our website. We track this click-through data to help us determine interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our customer communications. If you prefer not to be tracked in this way, you should not click text or graphic links in the email messages. Pixel tags enable us to send email messages in a format customers can read, and they tell us whether mail has been opened. We may use this information to reduce or eliminate messages sent to customers.

Children under the age of 13, or equivalent minimum age in the relevant jurisdiction, are not permitted to create their own Apple IDs, unless their parent provided verifiable consent or as part of the child account creation process in Family Sharing or they have obtained a Managed Apple ID account (where available) through their school. For example, a parent must review the Apple ID and Family Sharing Disclosure and agree to the Consent to Apple s Collection, Use and Disclosure of Your Child s Information  and the iTunes Store Terms and Conditions, before they can begin the Apple ID account creation process for their child. In addition, schools that participate in Apple School Manager and have reviewed and consented to the Managed Apple IDs for Students Disclosure may create Managed Apple IDs for students. The Managed Apple IDs for Students Disclosure describes how Apple handles student information and supplements Apple s Privacy Policy. Learn more about Family Sharing, the Managed Apple IDs and Restrictions for children s accounts. If we learn that we have collected the personal information of a child under 13, or equivalent minimum age depending on jurisdiction, outside the above circumstances we will take steps to delete the information as soon as possible. If at any time a parent needs to access, correct, or delete data associated with their Family Sharing account or child s Apple ID, they may contact us through one of the options provided at the bottom of this page.

[2019-04-01 12:01:47,424: WARNING/ForkPoolWorker-3] Collection and Use of Personal Information   Personal information is data that can be used to identify or contact a single person.   You may be asked to provide your personal information anytime you are in contact with Apple or  an Apple affiliated company. Apple and its affiliates may share this personal information with each  other and use it consistent with this Privacy Policy. They may also combine it with other  information to provide and improve our products, services, content, and advertising. You are not  required to provide the personal information that we have requested, but, if you chose not to do  so, in many cases we will not be able to provide you with our products or services or respond to  any queries you may have.   Here are some examples of the types of personal information Apple may collect and how we may  use it    What personal information we collect   When you create an Apple ID, apply for commercial credit, purchase a product, download a  software update, register for a class at an Apple Retail Store, connect to our services, contact us  or participate in an online survey, we may collect a variety of information, including your name,  mailing address, phone number, email address, contact preferences, device identifiers, IP  address, location information and credit card information.   When you share your content with family and friends using Apple products, send gift  certificates and products, or invite others to participate in Apple services or forums, Apple may  collect the information you provide about those people such as name, mailing address, email  address, and phone number. Apple will use such information to fulfill your requests, provide  the relevant product or service, or for anti-fraud purposes.   In certain jurisdictions, we may ask for a government issued ID in limited circumstances  including when setting up a wireless account and activating your device, for the purpose of  extending commercial credit, managing reservations, or as required by law.   https   www.apple.com legal privacy    How we use your personal information   We may process your personal information  for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, with  your consent, for compliance with a legal obligation to which Apple is subject or when we have  assessed it is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by Apple or a third  party to whom it may be necessary to disclose information.   The personal information we collect allows us to keep you posted on Apple s latest product  announcements, software updates, and upcoming events. If you don t want to be on our  mailing list, you can opt out anytime by updating your preferences.   We also use personal information to help us create, develop, operate, deliver, and improve our  products, services, content and advertising, and for loss prevention and anti-fraud purposes.  We may also use your personal information for account and network security purposes,  including in order to protect our services for the benefit of all our users. Where we use your  information for anti-fraud purposes it arises from the conduct of an online transaction with us.  We limit our uses of data for anti-fraud purposes to those which are strictly necessary and  within our assessed legitimate interests to protect our customers and our services. For certain  online transactions we may also validate the information provided by you with publicly  accessible sources.   We may use your personal information, including date of birth, to verify identity, assist with  identification of users, and to determine appropriate services. For example, we may use date of  birth to determine the age of Apple ID account holders.   From time to time, we may use your personal information to send important notices, such as  communications about purchases and changes to our terms, conditions, and policies. Because  this information is important to your interaction with Apple, you may not opt out of receiving  these communications.   We may also use personal information for internal purposes such as auditing, data analysis, and  research to improve Apple s products, services, and customer communications.   If you enter into a sweepstake, contest, or similar promotion we may use the information you  provide to administer those programs.   Source of your personal information where they are not collected from you   We may have received your personal information from other persons if that person has shared  their content with you using Apple products, sent gift certificates and products, or invited you to  participate in Apple services or forums. We may also validate the information provided by you  when creating an Apple ID with a third party for security and fraud prevention purposes.   For research and development purposes, we may use datasets such as those that contain images,  voices or other data that could be associated with an identifiable person. When acquiring such  datasets, we do so in accordance with applicable law in the jurisdiction in which the dataset is  hosted. When using such datasets for research and development, we do not attempt to re- identify individuals who may appear therein.

These technologies  help us better understand user behavior, tell us which parts of our websites people have visited,  and facilitate and measure the effectiveness of advertisements and web searches. We treat  information collected by cookies and other technologies as non-personal information. However,  to the extent that Internet Protocol (IP) addresses or similar identifiers are considered personal  information by local law, we also treat these identifiers as personal information. Similarly, to the  extent that non-personal information is combined with personal information, we treat the  combined information as personal information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.   Ads that are delivered by Apple s advertising platform may appear in Apple News and in the App  Store. If you do not wish to receive ads targeted to your interests from Apple's advertising  platform, you can choose to enable Limit Ad Tracking, which will opt your Apple ID out of receiving  such ads regardless of what device you are using. If you enable Limit AdTracking on your mobile  device, third-party apps cannot use the Advertising Identifier, a non-personal device identifier, to  serve you targeted ads. You may still see ads in the App Store or News based on context like your  search query or the channel you are reading. In third-party apps, you may see ads based on other  information.   https   www.apple.com in legal privacy en-ww cookies    Apple and our partners also use cookies and other technologies to remember personal  information when you use our website, online services, and applications. Our goal in these cases is  to make your experience with Apple more convenient and personal. For example, knowing your  first name lets us welcome you the next time you visit the Apple Online Store. Knowing your  country and language   and if you are an educator, your school   helps us provide a customized  and more useful shopping experience. Knowing someone using your computer or device has  shopped for a certain product or used a particular service helps us make our advertising and email  communications more relevant to your interests. And knowing your contact information,  hardware identifiers, and information about your computer or device helps us personalize your  operating system, set up your iCloud service, and provide you with better customer service.   If you want to disable cookies and you re using the Safari web browser, go to Safari preferences  and then to the privacy pane to manage your preferences. On your Apple mobile device, go to  Settings, then Safari, scroll down to the Privacy & Security section, and tap on  Block Cookies  to  manage your preferences. For other browsers, check with your provider to find out how to disable  cookies. Please note that certain features of the Apple website will not be available once cookies  are disabled.   As is true of most internet services, we gather some information automatically and store it in log  files. This information includes Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type and language,  Internet service provider (ISP), referring and exit websites and applications, operating system,  date time stamp, and clickstream data.   We use this information to understand and analyze trends, to administer the site, to learn about  user behavior on the site, to improve our product and services, and to gather demographic  information about our user base as a whole. Apple may use this information in our marketing and  advertising services.   In some of our email messages, we use a  click-through URL  linked to content on the Apple  website. When customers click one of these URLs, they pass through a separate web server  before arriving at the destination page on our website. We track this click-through data to help us  determine interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our customer  communications. If you prefer not to be tracked in this way, you should not click text or graphic  links in the email messages.   Pixel tags enable us to send email messages in a format customers can read, and they tell us  whether mail has been opened. We may use this information to reduce or eliminate messages  sent to customers.

Here are some examples of the types of personal information Apple may collect and how we may use it  What personal information we collect When you create an Apple ID, apply for commercial credit, purchase a product, download a software update, register for a class at an Apple Retail Store, connect to our services, contact us or participate in an online survey, we may collect a variety of information, including your name, mailing address, phone number, email address, contact preferences, device identifiers, IP address, location information and credit card information. When you share your content with family and friends using Apple products, send gift certificates and products, or invite others to participate in Apple services or forums, Apple may collect the information you provide about those people such as name, mailing address, email address, and phone number. Apple will use such information to fulfill your requests, provide the relevant product or service, or for anti-fraud purposes. In certain jurisdictions, we may ask for a government issued ID in limited circumstances including when setting up a wireless account and activating your device, for the purpose of extending commercial credit, managing reservations, or as required by law. How we use your personal information We may process your personal information  for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, with your consent, for compliance with a legal obligation to which Apple is subject or when we have assessed it is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by Apple or a third party to whom it may be necessary to disclose information. The personal information we collect allows us to keep you posted on Apple s latest product announcements, software updates, and upcoming events. If you don t want to be on our mailing list, you can opt out anytime by updating your preferences. We also use personal information to help us create, develop, operate, deliver, and improve our products, services, content and advertising, and for loss prevention and anti-fraud purposes. We may also use your personal information for account and network security purposes, including in order to protect our services for the benefit of all our users. Where we use your information for anti-fraud purposes it arises from the conduct of an online transaction with us. We limit our uses of data for anti-fraud purposes to those which are strictly necessary and within our assessed legitimate interests to protect our customers and our services. For certain online transactions we may also validate the information provided by you with publicly accessible sources. We may use your personal information, including date of birth, to verify identity, assist with identification of users, and to determine appropriate services. For example, we may use date of birth to determine the age of Apple ID account holders. From time to time, we may use your personal information to send important notices, such as communications about purchases and changes to our terms, conditions, and policies. Because this information is important to your interaction with Apple, you may not opt out of receiving these communications. We may also use personal information for internal purposes such as auditing, data analysis, and research to improve Apple s products, services, and customer communications. If you enter into a sweepstake, contest, or similar promotion we may use the information you provide to administer those programs. Source of your personal information where they are not collected from you We may have received your personal information from other persons if that person has shared their content with you using Apple products, sent gift certificates and products, or invited you to participate in Apple services or forums. We may also validate the information provided by you when creating an Apple ID with a third party for security and fraud prevention purposes. For research and development purposes, we may use datasets such as those that contain images, voices or other data that could be associated with an identifiable person. When acquiring such datasets, we do so in accordance with applicable law in the jurisdiction in which the dataset is hosted. When using such datasets for research and development, we do not attempt to re-identify individuals who may appear therein.

[2019-04-01 12:02:43,501: WARNING/ForkPoolWorker-3] Cookies and Other Technologies Apple s websites, online services, interactive applications, email messages, and advertisements may use "cookies" and other technologies such as pixel tags and web beacons. These technologies help us better understand user behavior, tell us which parts of our websites people have visited, and facilitate and measure the effectiveness of advertisements and web searches. We treat information collected by cookies and other technologies as nonpersonal information. However, to the extent that Internet Protocol (IP) addresses or similar identifiers are considered personal information by local law, we also treat these identifiers as personal information. Similarly, to the extent that non-personal information is combined with personal information, we treat the combined information as personal information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy. Ads that are delivered by Apple s advertising platform may appear in Apple News and in the App Store. If you do not wish to receive ads targeted to your interests from Apple's advertising platform, you can choose to enable Limit Ad Tracking, which will opt your Apple ID out of receiving such ads regardless of what device you are using. If you enable Limit AdTracking on your mobile device, third-party apps cannot use the Advertising Identifier, a non-personal device identifier, to serve you targeted ads. You may still see ads in the App Store or News based on context like your search query or the channel you are reading. In third-party apps, you may see ads based on other information. Apple and our partners also use cookies and other technologies to remember personal information when you use our website, online services, and applications. Our goal in these cases is to make your experience with Apple more convenient and personal. For example, knowing your first name lets us welcome you the next time you visit the Apple Online Store. Knowing your country and language   and if you are an educator, your school   helps us provide a customized and more useful shopping experience. Knowing someone using your computer or device has shopped for a certain product or used a particular service helps us make our advertising and email communications more relevant to your interests. And knowing your contact information, hardware identifiers, and information about your computer or device helps us personalize your operating system, set up your iCloud service, and provide you with better customer service. If you want to disable cookies and you re using the Safari web browser, go to Safari preferences and then to the privacy pane to manage your preferences. On your Apple mobile device, go to Settings, then Safari, scroll down to the Privacy & Security section, and tap on  Block Cookies  to manage your preferences. For other browsers, check with your provider to find out how to disable cookies. Please note that certain features of the Apple website will not be available once cookies are disabled. As is true of most internet services, we gather some information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type and language, Internet service provider (ISP), referring and exit websites and applications, operating system, date time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information to understand and analyze trends, to administer the site, to learn about user behavior on the site, to improve our product and services, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. Apple may use this information in our marketing and advertising services. In some of our email messages, we use a  click-through URL  linked to content on the Apple website. When customers click one of these URLs, they pass through a separate web server before arriving at the destination page on our website. We track this click-through data to help us determine interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our customer communications. If you prefer not to be tracked in this way, you should not click text or graphic links in the email messages. Pixel tags enable us to send email messages in a format customers can read, and they tell us whether mail has been opened. We may use this information to reduce or eliminate messages sent to customers.

[2019-04-01 12:02:43,649: WARNING/ForkPoolWorker-3] Children & Education We understand the importance of taking extra precautions to protect the privacy and safety of children using Apple products and services. Children under the age of 13, or equivalent minimum age in the relevant jurisdiction, are not permitted to create their own Apple IDs, unless their parent provided verifiable consent or as part of the child account creation process in Family Sharing or they have obtained a Managed Apple ID account (where available) through their school. For example, a parent must review the Apple ID and Family Sharing Disclosure and agree to the Consent to Apple s Collection, Use and Disclosure of Your Child s Information  and the iTunes Store Terms and Conditions, before they can begin the Apple ID account creation process for their child. In addition, schools that participate in Apple School Manager and have reviewed and consented to the Managed Apple IDs for Students Disclosure may create Managed Apple IDs for students. The Managed Apple IDs for Students Disclosure describes how Apple handles student information and supplements Apple s Privacy Policy. Learn more about Family Sharing, the Managed Apple IDs and Restrictions for children s accounts. If we learn that we have collected the personal information of a child under 13, or equivalent minimum age depending on jurisdiction, outside the above circumstances we will take steps to delete the information as soon as possible. If at any time a parent needs to access, correct, or delete data associated with their Family Sharing account or child s Apple ID, they may contact us through one of the options provided at the bottom of this page.

We have integrated SDK in our Platform that is designed to measure and analyze television  channel viewership of Hotstar Users ("TV SDK").    The TV SDK initiated after obtaining relevant permissions, uses the microphone on your  device to capture audio samples (including ambient sounds) and create encrypted  fingerprint files of such audio samples in real-time. The fingerprint files are matched against  a database of known fingerprints of television channels and television content to identify  and understand your television viewership patterns. The fingerprint files cannot be reverse  engineered into audio samples and are stored on your devices for a period not more than  48 hours. No actual audio samples or voices including conversations that you may have will  be saved on your device or transferred, at any point of time during the fingerprinting  process.    You may consent to the Platform accessing your device microphone and recording functions  for the fingerprinting process, as and when the pop-up appears on your device screen  requesting your explicit consent. You may at any time deny such consent on the consent  pop-up that appears from time to time or by disabling the microphone functionality on your  device. Should you require assistance to revoke your consent earlier given, please contact  us at our coordinates given towards the end of these Terms of Use.

These technologies  help us better understand user behavior, tell us which parts of our websites people have visited,  and facilitate and measure the effectiveness of advertisements and web searches. We treat  information collected by cookies and other technologies as non-personal information. However,  to the extent that Internet Protocol (IP) addresses or similar identifiers are considered personal  information by local law, we also treat these identifiers as personal information. Similarly, to the  extent that non-personal information is combined with personal information, we treat the  combined information as personal information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.   Ads that are delivered by Apple s advertising platform may appear in Apple News and in the App  Store. If you do not wish to receive ads targeted to your interests from Apple's advertising  platform, you can choose to enable Limit Ad Tracking, which will opt your Apple ID out of receiving  such ads regardless of what device you are using. If you enable Limit AdTracking on your mobile  device, third-party apps cannot use the Advertising Identifier, a non-personal device identifier, to  serve you targeted ads. You may still see ads in the App Store or News based on context like your  search query or the channel you are reading. In third-party apps, you may see ads based on other  information.   https   www.apple.com in legal privacy en-ww cookies    Apple and our partners also use cookies and other technologies to remember personal  information when you use our website, online services, and applications. Our goal in these cases is  to make your experience with Apple more convenient and personal. For example, knowing your  first name lets us welcome you the next time you visit the Apple Online Store. Knowing your  country and language   and if you are an educator, your school   helps us provide a customized  and more useful shopping experience. Knowing someone using your computer or device has  shopped for a certain product or used a particular service helps us make our advertising and email  communications more relevant to your interests. And knowing your contact information,  hardware identifiers, and information about your computer or device helps us personalize your  operating system, set up your iCloud service, and provide you with better customer service.   If you want to disable cookies and you re using the Safari web browser, go to Safari preferences  and then to the privacy pane to manage your preferences. On your Apple mobile device, go to  Settings, then Safari, scroll down to the Privacy & Security section, and tap on  Block Cookies  to  manage your preferences. For other browsers, check with your provider to find out how to disable  cookies. Please note that certain features of the Apple website will not be available once cookies  are disabled.   As is true of most internet services, we gather some information automatically and store it in log  files. This information includes Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type and language,  Internet service provider (ISP), referring and exit websites and applications, operating system,  date time stamp, and clickstream data.   We use this information to understand and analyze trends, to administer the site, to learn about  user behavior on the site, to improve our product and services, and to gather demographic  information about our user base as a whole. Apple may use this information in our marketing and  advertising services.   In some of our email messages, we use a  click-through URL  linked to content on the Apple  website. When customers click one of these URLs, they pass through a separate web server  before arriving at the destination page on our website. We track this click-through data to help us  determine interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our customer  communications. If you prefer not to be tracked in this way, you should not click text or graphic  links in the email messages.   Pixel tags enable us to send email messages in a format customers can read, and they tell us  whether mail has been opened. We may use this information to reduce or eliminate messages  sent to customers.

[2019-04-02 09:58:30,238: WARNING/ForkPoolWorker-3] Collection and Use of Personal Information   Personal information is data that can be used to identify or contact a single person.   You may be asked to provide your personal information anytime you are in contact with Apple or  an Apple affiliated company. Apple and its affiliates may share this personal information with each  other and use it consistent with this Privacy Policy. They may also combine it with other  information to provide and improve our products, services, content, and advertising. You are not  required to provide the personal information that we have requested, but, if you chose not to do  so, in many cases we will not be able to provide you with our products or services or respond to  any queries you may have.   Here are some examples of the types of personal information Apple may collect and how we may  use it    What personal information we collect   When you create an Apple ID, apply for commercial credit, purchase a product, download a  software update, register for a class at an Apple Retail Store, connect to our services, contact us  or participate in an online survey, we may collect a variety of information, including your name,  mailing address, phone number, email address, contact preferences, device identifiers, IP  address, location information and credit card information.   When you share your content with family and friends using Apple products, send gift  certificates and products, or invite others to participate in Apple services or forums, Apple may  collect the information you provide about those people such as name, mailing address, email  address, and phone number. Apple will use such information to fulfill your requests, provide  the relevant product or service, or for anti-fraud purposes.   In certain jurisdictions, we may ask for a government issued ID in limited circumstances  including when setting up a wireless account and activating your device, for the purpose of  extending commercial credit, managing reservations, or as required by law.   https   www.apple.com legal privacy    How we use your personal information   We may process your personal information  for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, with  your consent, for compliance with a legal obligation to which Apple is subject or when we have  assessed it is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by Apple or a third  party to whom it may be necessary to disclose information.   The personal information we collect allows us to keep you posted on Apple s latest product  announcements, software updates, and upcoming events. If you don t want to be on our  mailing list, you can opt out anytime by updating your preferences.   We also use personal information to help us create, develop, operate, deliver, and improve our  products, services, content and advertising, and for loss prevention and anti-fraud purposes.  We may also use your personal information for account and network security purposes,  including in order to protect our services for the benefit of all our users. Where we use your  information for anti-fraud purposes it arises from the conduct of an online transaction with us.  We limit our uses of data for anti-fraud purposes to those which are strictly necessary and  within our assessed legitimate interests to protect our customers and our services. For certain  online transactions we may also validate the information provided by you with publicly  accessible sources.   We may use your personal information, including date of birth, to verify identity, assist with  identification of users, and to determine appropriate services. For example, we may use date of  birth to determine the age of Apple ID account holders.   From time to time, we may use your personal information to send important notices, such as  communications about purchases and changes to our terms, conditions, and policies. Because  this information is important to your interaction with Apple, you may not opt out of receiving  these communications.   We may also use personal information for internal purposes such as auditing, data analysis, and  research to improve Apple s products, services, and customer communications.   If you enter into a sweepstake, contest, or similar promotion we may use the information you  provide to administer those programs.   Source of your personal information where they are not collected from you   We may have received your personal information from other persons if that person has shared  their content with you using Apple products, sent gift certificates and products, or invited you to  participate in Apple services or forums. We may also validate the information provided by you  when creating an Apple ID with a third party for security and fraud prevention purposes.   For research and development purposes, we may use datasets such as those that contain images,  voices or other data that could be associated with an identifiable person. When acquiring such  datasets, we do so in accordance with applicable law in the jurisdiction in which the dataset is  hosted. When using such datasets for research and development, we do not attempt to re- identify individuals who may appear therein.

These technologies  help us better understand user behavior, tell us which parts of our websites people have visited,  and facilitate and measure the effectiveness of advertisements and web searches. We treat  information collected by cookies and other technologies as non-personal information. However,  to the extent that Internet Protocol (IP) addresses or similar identifiers are considered personal  information by local law, we also treat these identifiers as personal information. Similarly, to the  extent that non-personal information is combined with personal information, we treat the  combined information as personal information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.   Ads that are delivered by Apple s advertising platform may appear in Apple News and in the App  Store. If you do not wish to receive ads targeted to your interests from Apple's advertising  platform, you can choose to enable Limit Ad Tracking, which will opt your Apple ID out of receiving  such ads regardless of what device you are using. If you enable Limit AdTracking on your mobile  device, third-party apps cannot use the Advertising Identifier, a non-personal device identifier, to  serve you targeted ads. You may still see ads in the App Store or News based on context like your  search query or the channel you are reading. In third-party apps, you may see ads based on other  information.   https   www.apple.com in legal privacy en-ww cookies    Apple and our partners also use cookies and other technologies to remember personal  information when you use our website, online services, and applications. Our goal in these cases is  to make your experience with Apple more convenient and personal. For example, knowing your  first name lets us welcome you the next time you visit the Apple Online Store. Knowing your  country and language   and if you are an educator, your school   helps us provide a customized  and more useful shopping experience. Knowing someone using your computer or device has  shopped for a certain product or used a particular service helps us make our advertising and email  communications more relevant to your interests. And knowing your contact information,  hardware identifiers, and information about your computer or device helps us personalize your  operating system, set up your iCloud service, and provide you with better customer service.   If you want to disable cookies and you re using the Safari web browser, go to Safari preferences  and then to the privacy pane to manage your preferences. On your Apple mobile device, go to  Settings, then Safari, scroll down to the Privacy & Security section, and tap on  Block Cookies  to  manage your preferences. For other browsers, check with your provider to find out how to disable  cookies. Please note that certain features of the Apple website will not be available once cookies  are disabled.   As is true of most internet services, we gather some information automatically and store it in log  files. This information includes Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type and language,  Internet service provider (ISP), referring and exit websites and applications, operating system,  date time stamp, and clickstream data.   We use this information to understand and analyze trends, to administer the site, to learn about  user behavior on the site, to improve our product and services, and to gather demographic  information about our user base as a whole. Apple may use this information in our marketing and  advertising services.   In some of our email messages, we use a  click-through URL  linked to content on the Apple  website. When customers click one of these URLs, they pass through a separate web server  before arriving at the destination page on our website. We track this click-through data to help us  determine interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our customer  communications. If you prefer not to be tracked in this way, you should not click text or graphic  links in the email messages.   Pixel tags enable us to send email messages in a format customers can read, and they tell us  whether mail has been opened. We may use this information to reduce or eliminate messages  sent to customers.

[2019-04-02 10:40:23,204: WARNING/ForkPoolWorker-1] Collection and Use of Personal Information   Personal information is data that can be used to identify or contact a single person.   You may be asked to provide your personal information anytime you are in contact with Apple or  an Apple affiliated company. Apple and its affiliates may share this personal information with each  other and use it consistent with this Privacy Policy. They may also combine it with other  information to provide and improve our products, services, content, and advertising. You are not  required to provide the personal information that we have requested, but, if you chose not to do  so, in many cases we will not be able to provide you with our products or services or respond to  any queries you may have.   Here are some examples of the types of personal information Apple may collect and how we may  use it    What personal information we collect   When you create an Apple ID, apply for commercial credit, purchase a product, download a  software update, register for a class at an Apple Retail Store, connect to our services, contact us  or participate in an online survey, we may collect a variety of information, including your name,  mailing address, phone number, email address, contact preferences, device identifiers, IP  address, location information and credit card information.   When you share your content with family and friends using Apple products, send gift  certificates and products, or invite others to participate in Apple services or forums, Apple may  collect the information you provide about those people such as name, mailing address, email  address, and phone number. Apple will use such information to fulfill your requests, provide  the relevant product or service, or for anti-fraud purposes.   In certain jurisdictions, we may ask for a government issued ID in limited circumstances  including when setting up a wireless account and activating your device, for the purpose of  extending commercial credit, managing reservations, or as required by law.   https   www.apple.com legal privacy    How we use your personal information   We may process your personal information  for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, with  your consent, for compliance with a legal obligation to which Apple is subject or when we have  assessed it is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by Apple or a third  party to whom it may be necessary to disclose information.   The personal information we collect allows us to keep you posted on Apple s latest product  announcements, software updates, and upcoming events. If you don t want to be on our  mailing list, you can opt out anytime by updating your preferences.   We also use personal information to help us create, develop, operate, deliver, and improve our  products, services, content and advertising, and for loss prevention and anti-fraud purposes.  We may also use your personal information for account and network security purposes,  including in order to protect our services for the benefit of all our users. Where we use your  information for anti-fraud purposes it arises from the conduct of an online transaction with us.  We limit our uses of data for anti-fraud purposes to those which are strictly necessary and  within our assessed legitimate interests to protect our customers and our services. For certain  online transactions we may also validate the information provided by you with publicly  accessible sources.   We may use your personal information, including date of birth, to verify identity, assist with  identification of users, and to determine appropriate services. For example, we may use date of  birth to determine the age of Apple ID account holders.   From time to time, we may use your personal information to send important notices, such as  communications about purchases and changes to our terms, conditions, and policies. Because  this information is important to your interaction with Apple, you may not opt out of receiving  these communications.   We may also use personal information for internal purposes such as auditing, data analysis, and  research to improve Apple s products, services, and customer communications.   If you enter into a sweepstake, contest, or similar promotion we may use the information you  provide to administer those programs.   Source of your personal information where they are not collected from you   We may have received your personal information from other persons if that person has shared  their content with you using Apple products, sent gift certificates and products, or invited you to  participate in Apple services or forums. We may also validate the information provided by you  when creating an Apple ID with a third party for security and fraud prevention purposes.   For research and development purposes, we may use datasets such as those that contain images,  voices or other data that could be associated with an identifiable person. When acquiring such  datasets, we do so in accordance with applicable law in the jurisdiction in which the dataset is  hosted.

These technologies  help us better understand user behavior, tell us which parts of our websites people have visited,  and facilitate and measure the effectiveness of advertisements and web searches. We treat  information collected by cookies and other technologies as non-personal information. However,  to the extent that Internet Protocol (IP) addresses or similar identifiers are considered personal  information by local law, we also treat these identifiers as personal information. Similarly, to the  extent that non-personal information is combined with personal information, we treat the  combined information as personal information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.   Ads that are delivered by Apple s advertising platform may appear in Apple News and in the App  Store. If you do not wish to receive ads targeted to your interests from Apple's advertising  platform, you can choose to enable Limit Ad Tracking, which will opt your Apple ID out of receiving  such ads regardless of what device you are using. If you enable Limit AdTracking on your mobile  device, third-party apps cannot use the Advertising Identifier, a non-personal device identifier, to  serve you targeted ads. You may still see ads in the App Store or News based on context like your  search query or the channel you are reading.

Our goal in these cases is  to make your experience with Apple more convenient and personal. For example, knowing your  first name lets us welcome you the next time you visit the Apple Online Store. Knowing your  country and language   and if you are an educator, your school   helps us provide a customized  and more useful shopping experience. Knowing someone using your computer or device has  shopped for a certain product or used a particular service helps us make our advertising and email  communications more relevant to your interests. And knowing your contact information,  hardware identifiers, and information about your computer or device helps us personalize your  operating system, set up your iCloud service, and provide you with better customer service.   If you want to disable cookies and you re using the Safari web browser, go to Safari preferences  and then to the privacy pane to manage your preferences. On your Apple mobile device, go to  Settings, then Safari, scroll down to the Privacy & Security section, and tap on  Block Cookies  to  manage your preferences. For other browsers, check with your provider to find out how to disable  cookies. Please note that certain features of the Apple website will not be available once cookies  are disabled.   As is true of most internet services, we gather some information automatically and store it in log  files. This information includes Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type and language,  Internet service provider (ISP), referring and exit websites and applications, operating system,  date time stamp, and clickstream data.   We use this information to understand and analyze trends, to administer the site, to learn about  user behavior on the site, to improve our product and services, and to gather demographic  information about our user base as a whole. Apple may use this information in our marketing and  advertising services.   In some of our email messages, we use a  click-through URL  linked to content on the Apple  website. When customers click one of these URLs, they pass through a separate web server  before arriving at the destination page on our website. We track this click-through data to help us  determine interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our customer  communications. If you prefer not to be tracked in this way, you should not click text or graphic  links in the email messages.   Pixel tags enable us to send email messages in a format customers can read, and they tell us  whether mail has been opened. We may use this information to reduce or eliminate messages  sent to customers.

[2019-04-02 11:14:50,948: WARNING/ForkPoolWorker-3] Collection and Use of Personal Information   Personal information is data that can be used to identify or contact a single person.   You may be asked to provide your personal information anytime you are in contact with Apple or  an Apple affiliated company. Apple and its affiliates may share this personal information with each  other and use it consistent with this Privacy Policy. They may also combine it with other  information to provide and improve our products, services, content, and advertising. You are not  required to provide the personal information that we have requested, but, if you chose not to do  so, in many cases we will not be able to provide you with our products or services or respond to  any queries you may have.   Here are some examples of the types of personal information Apple may collect and how we may  use it    What personal information we collect   When you create an Apple ID, apply for commercial credit, purchase a product, download a  software update, register for a class at an Apple Retail Store, connect to our services, contact us  or participate in an online survey, we may collect a variety of information, including your name,  mailing address, phone number, email address, contact preferences, device identifiers, IP  address, location information and credit card information.   When you share your content with family and friends using Apple products, send gift  certificates and products, or invite others to participate in Apple services or forums, Apple may  collect the information you provide about those people such as name, mailing address, email  address, and phone number. Apple will use such information to fulfill your requests, provide  the relevant product or service, or for anti-fraud purposes.   In certain jurisdictions, we may ask for a government issued ID in limited circumstances  including when setting up a wireless account and activating your device, for the purpose of  extending commercial credit, managing reservations, or as required by law.   https   www.apple.com legal privacy    How we use your personal information   We may process your personal information  for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, with  your consent, for compliance with a legal obligation to which Apple is subject or when we have  assessed it is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by Apple or a third  party to whom it may be necessary to disclose information.   The personal information we collect allows us to keep you posted on Apple s latest product  announcements, software updates, and upcoming events. If you don t want to be on our  mailing list, you can opt out anytime by updating your preferences.   We also use personal information to help us create, develop, operate, deliver, and improve our  products, services, content and advertising, and for loss prevention and anti-fraud purposes.  We may also use your personal information for account and network security purposes,  including in order to protect our services for the benefit of all our users. Where we use your  information for anti-fraud purposes it arises from the conduct of an online transaction with us.  We limit our uses of data for anti-fraud purposes to those which are strictly necessary and  within our assessed legitimate interests to protect our customers and our services. For certain  online transactions we may also validate the information provided by you with publicly  accessible sources.   We may use your personal information, including date of birth, to verify identity, assist with  identification of users, and to determine appropriate services. For example, we may use date of  birth to determine the age of Apple ID account holders.   From time to time, we may use your personal information to send important notices, such as  communications about purchases and changes to our terms, conditions, and policies. Because  this information is important to your interaction with Apple, you may not opt out of receiving  these communications.   We may also use personal information for internal purposes such as auditing, data analysis, and  research to improve Apple s products, services, and customer communications.   If you enter into a sweepstake, contest, or similar promotion we may use the information you  provide to administer those programs.   Source of your personal information where they are not collected from you   We may have received your personal information from other persons if that person has shared  their content with you using Apple products, sent gift certificates and products, or invited you to  participate in Apple services or forums. We may also validate the information provided by you  when creating an Apple ID with a third party for security and fraud prevention purposes.   For research and development purposes, we may use datasets such as those that contain images,  voices or other data that could be associated with an identifiable person. When acquiring such  datasets, we do so in accordance with applicable law in the jurisdiction in which the dataset is  hosted. When using such datasets for research and development, we do not attempt to re- identify individuals who may appear therein.

These technologies  help us better understand user behavior, tell us which parts of our websites people have visited,  and facilitate and measure the effectiveness of advertisements and web searches. We treat  information collected by cookies and other technologies as non-personal information. However,  to the extent that Internet Protocol (IP) addresses or similar identifiers are considered personal  information by local law, we also treat these identifiers as personal information. Similarly, to the  extent that non-personal information is combined with personal information, we treat the  combined information as personal information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.   Ads that are delivered by Apple s advertising platform may appear in Apple News and in the App  Store. If you do not wish to receive ads targeted to your interests from Apple's advertising  platform, you can choose to enable Limit Ad Tracking, which will opt your Apple ID out of receiving  such ads regardless of what device you are using. If you enable Limit AdTracking on your mobile  device, third-party apps cannot use the Advertising Identifier, a non-personal device identifier, to  serve you targeted ads. You may still see ads in the App Store or News based on context like your  search query or the channel you are reading. In third-party apps, you may see ads based on other  information.   https   www.apple.com in legal privacy en-ww cookies    Apple and our partners also use cookies and other technologies to remember personal  information when you use our website, online services, and applications. Our goal in these cases is  to make your experience with Apple more convenient and personal. For example, knowing your  first name lets us welcome you the next time you visit the Apple Online Store. Knowing your  country and language   and if you are an educator, your school   helps us provide a customized  and more useful shopping experience. Knowing someone using your computer or device has  shopped for a certain product or used a particular service helps us make our advertising and email  communications more relevant to your interests. And knowing your contact information,  hardware identifiers, and information about your computer or device helps us personalize your  operating system, set up your iCloud service, and provide you with better customer service.   If you want to disable cookies and you re using the Safari web browser, go to Safari preferences  and then to the privacy pane to manage your preferences. On your Apple mobile device, go to  Settings, then Safari, scroll down to the Privacy & Security section, and tap on  Block Cookies  to  manage your preferences. For other browsers, check with your provider to find out how to disable  cookies. Please note that certain features of the Apple website will not be available once cookies  are disabled.   As is true of most internet services, we gather some information automatically and store it in log  files. This information includes Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type and language,  Internet service provider (ISP), referring and exit websites and applications, operating system,  date time stamp, and clickstream data.   We use this information to understand and analyze trends, to administer the site, to learn about  user behavior on the site, to improve our product and services, and to gather demographic  information about our user base as a whole. Apple may use this information in our marketing and  advertising services.   In some of our email messages, we use a  click-through URL  linked to content on the Apple  website. When customers click one of these URLs, they pass through a separate web server  before arriving at the destination page on our website. We track this click-through data to help us  determine interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our customer  communications. If you prefer not to be tracked in this way, you should not click text or graphic  links in the email messages.   Pixel tags enable us to send email messages in a format customers can read, and they tell us  whether mail has been opened. We may use this information to reduce or eliminate messages  sent to customers.

They may also combine it with other  information to provide and improve our products, services, content, and advertising. You are not  required to provide the personal information that we have requested, but, if you chose not to do  so, in many cases we will not be able to provide you with our products or services or respond to  any queries you may have.

When you share your content with family and friends using Apple products, send gift  certificates and products, or invite others to participate in Apple services or forums, Apple may  collect the information you provide about those people such as name, mailing address, email  address, and phone number. Apple will use such information to fulfill your requests, provide  the relevant product or service, or for anti-fraud purposes.

The personal information we collect allows us to keep you posted on Apple s latest product  announcements, software updates, and upcoming events. If you don t want to be on our  mailing list, you can opt out anytime by updating your preferences.   We also use personal information to help us create, develop, operate, deliver, and improve our  products, services, content and advertising, and for loss prevention and anti-fraud purposes.  We may also use your personal information for account and network security purposes,  including in order to protect our services for the benefit of all our users. Where we use your  information for anti-fraud purposes it arises from the conduct of an online transaction with us.  We limit our uses of data for anti-fraud purposes to those which are strictly necessary and  within our assessed legitimate interests to protect our customers and our services. For certain  online transactions we may also validate the information provided by you with publicly  accessible sources.   We may use your personal information, including date of birth, to verify identity, assist with  identification of users, and to determine appropriate services. For example, we may use date of  birth to determine the age of Apple ID account holders.   From time to time, we may use your personal information to send important notices, such as  communications about purchases and changes to our terms, conditions, and policies. Because  this information is important to your interaction with Apple, you may not opt out of receiving  these communications.   We may also use personal information for internal purposes such as auditing, data analysis, and  research to improve Apple s products, services, and customer communications.   If you enter into a sweepstake, contest, or similar promotion we may use the information you  provide to administer those programs.   Source of your personal information where they are not collected from you   We may have received your personal information from other persons if that person has shared  their content with you using Apple products, sent gift certificates and products, or invited you to  participate in Apple services or forums.

For research and development purposes, we may use datasets such as those that contain images,  voices or other data that could be associated with an identifiable person. When acquiring such  datasets, we do so in accordance with applicable law in the jurisdiction in which the dataset is  hosted. When using such datasets for research and development, we do not attempt to re- identify individuals who may appear therein.

These technologies  help us better understand user behavior, tell us which parts of our websites people have visited,  and facilitate and measure the effectiveness of advertisements and web searches. We treat  information collected by cookies and other technologies as non-personal information. However,  to the extent that Internet Protocol (IP) addresses or similar identifiers are considered personal  information by local law, we also treat these identifiers as personal information. Similarly, to the  extent that non-personal information is combined with personal information, we treat the  combined information as personal information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.   Ads that are delivered by Apple s advertising platform may appear in Apple News and in the App  Store. If you do not wish to receive ads targeted to your interests from Apple's advertising  platform, you can choose to enable Limit Ad Tracking, which will opt your Apple ID out of receiving  such ads regardless of what device you are using. If you enable Limit AdTracking on your mobile  device, third-party apps cannot use the Advertising Identifier, a non-personal device identifier, to  serve you targeted ads. You may still see ads in the App Store or News based on context like your  search query or the channel you are reading. In third-party apps, you may see ads based on other  information.   https   www.apple.com in legal privacy en-ww cookies    Apple and our partners also use cookies and other technologies to remember personal  information when you use our website, online services, and applications. Our goal in these cases is  to make your experience with Apple more convenient and personal. For example, knowing your  first name lets us welcome you the next time you visit the Apple Online Store. Knowing your  country and language   and if you are an educator, your school   helps us provide a customized  and more useful shopping experience. Knowing someone using your computer or device has  shopped for a certain product or used a particular service helps us make our advertising and email  communications more relevant to your interests. And knowing your contact information,  hardware identifiers, and information about your computer or device helps us personalize your  operating system, set up your iCloud service, and provide you with better customer service.   If you want to disable cookies and you re using the Safari web browser, go to Safari preferences  and then to the privacy pane to manage your preferences. On your Apple mobile device, go to  Settings, then Safari, scroll down to the Privacy & Security section, and tap on  Block Cookies  to  manage your preferences. For other browsers, check with your provider to find out how to disable  cookies. Please note that certain features of the Apple website will not be available once cookies  are disabled.   As is true of most internet services, we gather some information automatically and store it in log  files. This information includes Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type and language,  Internet service provider (ISP), referring and exit websites and applications, operating system,  date time stamp, and clickstream data.   We use this information to understand and analyze trends, to administer the site, to learn about  user behavior on the site, to improve our product and services, and to gather demographic  information about our user base as a whole. Apple may use this information in our marketing and  advertising services.   In some of our email messages, we use a  click-through URL  linked to content on the Apple  website. When customers click one of these URLs, they pass through a separate web server  before arriving at the destination page on our website. We track this click-through data to help us  determine interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our customer  communications. If you prefer not to be tracked in this way, you should not click text or graphic  links in the email messages.   Pixel tags enable us to send email messages in a format customers can read, and they tell us  whether mail has been opened. We may use this information to reduce or eliminate messages  sent to customers.

[2019-04-02 11:19:34,645: WARNING/ForkPoolWorker-1] Children & Education   We understand the importance of taking extra precautions to protect the privacy and safety of  children using Apple products and services. Children under the age of 13, or equivalent minimum  age in the relevant jurisdiction, are not permitted to create their own Apple IDs, unless their  parent provided verifiable consent or as part of the child account creation process in Family  Sharing or they have obtained a Managed Apple ID account (where available) through their  school. For example, a parent must review the Apple ID and Family Sharing Disclosure and agree  to the Consent to Apple s Collection, Use and Disclosure of Your Child s Information  and  the iTunes Store Terms and Conditions, before they can begin the Apple ID account creation  process for their child. In addition, schools that participate in Apple School Manager and have  reviewed and consented to the Managed Apple IDs for Students Disclosure may create Managed  Apple IDs for students. The Managed Apple IDs for Students Disclosure describes how Apple   https   appleid.apple.com  http   privacy.apple.com  http   apple.com legal privacy contact https   www.apple.com in legal privacy en-ww parent-disclosure  https   www.apple.com in legal privacy en-ww parent-disclosure #consent https   www.apple.com in legal internet-services itunes  https   www.apple.com in legal education apple-school-manager    handles student information and supplements Apple s Privacy Policy.

If we learn that we have collected the personal information of a child under 13, or equivalent  minimum age depending on jurisdiction, outside the above circumstances we will take steps to  delete the information as soon as possible.   If at any time a parent needs to access, correct, or delete data associated with their Family Sharing  account or child s Apple ID, they may contact us through one of the options provided at the  bottom of this page.

For research and development purposes, we may use datasets such as those that contain images,  voices or other data that could be associated with an identifiable person. When acquiring such  datasets, we do so in accordance with applicable law in the jurisdiction in which the dataset is  hosted. When using such datasets for research and development, we do not attempt to re- identify individuals who may appear therein.

[2019-04-02 11:21:10,096: WARNING/ForkPoolWorker-3] Cookies and Other Technologies   Apple s websites, online services, interactive applications, email messages, and advertisements  may use "cookies" and other technologies such as pixel tags and web beacons. These technologies  help us better understand user behavior, tell us which parts of our websites people have visited,  and facilitate and measure the effectiveness of advertisements and web searches. We treat  information collected by cookies and other technologies as non-personal information. However,  to the extent that Internet Protocol (IP) addresses or similar identifiers are considered personal  information by local law, we also treat these identifiers as personal information. Similarly, to the  extent that non-personal information is combined with personal information, we treat the  combined information as personal information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.   Ads that are delivered by Apple s advertising platform may appear in Apple News and in the App  Store. If you do not wish to receive ads targeted to your interests from Apple's advertising  platform, you can choose to enable Limit Ad Tracking, which will opt your Apple ID out of receiving  such ads regardless of what device you are using. If you enable Limit AdTracking on your mobile  device, third-party apps cannot use the Advertising Identifier, a non-personal device identifier, to  serve you targeted ads. You may still see ads in the App Store or News based on context like your  search query or the channel you are reading. In third-party apps, you may see ads based on other  information.   https   www.apple.com in legal privacy en-ww cookies    Apple and our partners also use cookies and other technologies to remember personal  information when you use our website, online services, and applications. Our goal in these cases is  to make your experience with Apple more convenient and personal. For example, knowing your  first name lets us welcome you the next time you visit the Apple Online Store. Knowing your  country and language   and if you are an educator, your school   helps us provide a customized  and more useful shopping experience. Knowing someone using your computer or device has  shopped for a certain product or used a particular service helps us make our advertising and email  communications more relevant to your interests. And knowing your contact information,  hardware identifiers, and information about your computer or device helps us personalize your  operating system, set up your iCloud service, and provide you with better customer service.   If you want to disable cookies and you re using the Safari web browser, go to Safari preferences  and then to the privacy pane to manage your preferences. On your Apple mobile device, go to  Settings, then Safari, scroll down to the Privacy & Security section, and tap on  Block Cookies  to  manage your preferences. For other browsers, check with your provider to find out how to disable  cookies. Please note that certain features of the Apple website will not be available once cookies  are disabled.   As is true of most internet services, we gather some information automatically and store it in log  files. This information includes Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type and language,  Internet service provider (ISP), referring and exit websites and applications, operating system,  date time stamp, and clickstream data.   We use this information to understand and analyze trends, to administer the site, to learn about  user behavior on the site, to improve our product and services, and to gather demographic  information about our user base as a whole. Apple may use this information in our marketing and  advertising services.   In some of our email messages, we use a  click-through URL  linked to content on the Apple  website. When customers click one of these URLs, they pass through a separate web server  before arriving at the destination page on our website. We track this click-through data to help us  determine interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our customer  communications. If you prefer not to be tracked in this way, you should not click text or graphic  links in the email messages.   Pixel tags enable us to send email messages in a format customers can read, and they tell us  whether mail has been opened. We may use this information to reduce or eliminate messages  sent to customers.

[2019-04-02 11:26:20,622: WARNING/ForkPoolWorker-1] Collection and Use of Personal Information   Personal information is data that can be used to identify or contact a single person.   You may be asked to provide your personal information anytime you are in contact with Apple or  an Apple affiliated company. Apple and its affiliates may share this personal information with each  other and use it consistent with this Privacy Policy. They may also combine it with other  information to provide and improve our products, services, content, and advertising. You are not  required to provide the personal information that we have requested, but, if you chose not to do  so, in many cases we will not be able to provide you with our products or services or respond to  any queries you may have.   Here are some examples of the types of personal information Apple may collect and how we may  use it    What personal information we collect   When you create an Apple ID, apply for commercial credit, purchase a product, download a  software update, register for a class at an Apple Retail Store, connect to our services, contact us  or participate in an online survey, we may collect a variety of information, including your name,  mailing address, phone number, email address, contact preferences, device identifiers, IP  address, location information and credit card information.   When you share your content with family and friends using Apple products, send gift  certificates and products, or invite others to participate in Apple services or forums, Apple may  collect the information you provide about those people such as name, mailing address, email  address, and phone number. Apple will use such information to fulfill your requests, provide  the relevant product or service, or for anti-fraud purposes.   In certain jurisdictions, we may ask for a government issued ID in limited circumstances  including when setting up a wireless account and activating your device, for the purpose of  extending commercial credit, managing reservations, or as required by law.   https   www.apple.com legal privacy    How we use your personal information   We may process your personal information  for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, with  your consent, for compliance with a legal obligation to which Apple is subject or when we have  assessed it is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by Apple or a third  party to whom it may be necessary to disclose information.   The personal information we collect allows us to keep you posted on Apple s latest product  announcements, software updates, and upcoming events. If you don t want to be on our  mailing list, you can opt out anytime by updating your preferences.   We also use personal information to help us create, develop, operate, deliver, and improve our  products, services, content and advertising, and for loss prevention and anti-fraud purposes.  We may also use your personal information for account and network security purposes,  including in order to protect our services for the benefit of all our users. Where we use your  information for anti-fraud purposes it arises from the conduct of an online transaction with us.  We limit our uses of data for anti-fraud purposes to those which are strictly necessary and  within our assessed legitimate interests to protect our customers and our services. For certain  online transactions we may also validate the information provided by you with publicly  accessible sources.   We may use your personal information, including date of birth, to verify identity, assist with  identification of users, and to determine appropriate services. For example, we may use date of  birth to determine the age of Apple ID account holders.   From time to time, we may use your personal information to send important notices, such as  communications about purchases and changes to our terms, conditions, and policies. Because  this information is important to your interaction with Apple, you may not opt out of receiving  these communications.   We may also use personal information for internal purposes such as auditing, data analysis, and  research to improve Apple s products, services, and customer communications.   If you enter into a sweepstake, contest, or similar promotion we may use the information you  provide to administer those programs.   Source of your personal information where they are not collected from you   We may have received your personal information from other persons if that person has shared  their content with you using Apple products, sent gift certificates and products, or invited you to  participate in Apple services or forums. We may also validate the information provided by you  when creating an Apple ID with a third party for security and fraud prevention purposes.   For research and development purposes, we may use datasets such as those that contain images,  voices or other data that could be associated with an identifiable person. When acquiring such  datasets, we do so in accordance with applicable law in the jurisdiction in which the dataset is  hosted. When using such datasets for research and development, we do not attempt to re- identify individuals who may appear therein.

We treat  information collected by cookies and other technologies as non-personal information. However,  to the extent that Internet Protocol (IP) addresses or similar identifiers are considered personal  information by local law, we also treat these identifiers as personal information. Similarly, to the  extent that non-personal information is combined with personal information, we treat the  combined information as personal information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.   Ads that are delivered by Apple s advertising platform may appear in Apple News and in the App  Store. If you do not wish to receive ads targeted to your interests from Apple's advertising  platform, you can choose to enable Limit Ad Tracking, which will opt your Apple ID out of receiving  such ads regardless of what device you are using. If you enable Limit AdTracking on your mobile  device, third-party apps cannot use the Advertising Identifier, a non-personal device identifier, to  serve you targeted ads.

Our goal in these cases is  to make your experience with Apple more convenient and personal. For example, knowing your  first name lets us welcome you the next time you visit the Apple Online Store. Knowing your  country and language   and if you are an educator, your school   helps us provide a customized  and more useful shopping experience. Knowing someone using your computer or device has  shopped for a certain product or used a particular service helps us make our advertising and email  communications more relevant to your interests.

On your Apple mobile device, go to  Settings, then Safari, scroll down to the Privacy & Security section, and tap on  Block Cookies  to  manage your preferences. For other browsers, check with your provider to find out how to disable  cookies. Please note that certain features of the Apple website will not be available once cookies  are disabled.   As is true of most internet services, we gather some information automatically and store it in log  files. This information includes Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type and language,  Internet service provider (ISP), referring and exit websites and applications, operating system,  date time stamp, and clickstream data.   We use this information to understand and analyze trends, to administer the site, to learn about  user behavior on the site, to improve our product and services, and to gather demographic  information about our user base as a whole. Apple may use this information in our marketing and  advertising services.   In some of our email messages, we use a  click-through URL  linked to content on the Apple  website. When customers click one of these URLs, they pass through a separate web server  before arriving at the destination page on our website. We track this click-through data to help us  determine interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our customer  communications. If you prefer not to be tracked in this way, you should not click text or graphic  links in the email messages.

[2019-04-02 11:29:58,560: WARNING/ForkPoolWorker-3] Collection and Use of Personal Information   Personal information is data that can be used to identify or contact a single person.   You may be asked to provide your personal information anytime you are in contact with Apple or  an Apple affiliated company. Apple and its affiliates may share this personal information with each  other and use it consistent with this Privacy Policy. They may also combine it with other  information to provide and improve our products, services, content, and advertising. You are not  required to provide the personal information that we have requested, but, if you chose not to do  so, in many cases we will not be able to provide you with our products or services or respond to  any queries you may have.   Here are some examples of the types of personal information Apple may collect and how we may  use it    What personal information we collect   When you create an Apple ID, apply for commercial credit, purchase a product, download a  software update, register for a class at an Apple Retail Store, connect to our services, contact us  or participate in an online survey, we may collect a variety of information, including your name,  mailing address, phone number, email address, contact preferences, device identifiers, IP  address, location information and credit card information.   When you share your content with family and friends using Apple products, send gift  certificates and products, or invite others to participate in Apple services or forums, Apple may  collect the information you provide about those people such as name, mailing address, email  address, and phone number. Apple will use such information to fulfill your requests, provide  the relevant product or service, or for anti-fraud purposes.   In certain jurisdictions, we may ask for a government issued ID in limited circumstances  including when setting up a wireless account and activating your device, for the purpose of  extending commercial credit, managing reservations, or as required by law.   https   www.apple.com legal privacy    How we use your personal information   We may process your personal information  for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, with  your consent, for compliance with a legal obligation to which Apple is subject or when we have  assessed it is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by Apple or a third  party to whom it may be necessary to disclose information.   The personal information we collect allows us to keep you posted on Apple s latest product  announcements, software updates, and upcoming events. If you don t want to be on our  mailing list, you can opt out anytime by updating your preferences.   We also use personal information to help us create, develop, operate, deliver, and improve our  products, services, content and advertising, and for loss prevention and anti-fraud purposes.  We may also use your personal information for account and network security purposes,  including in order to protect our services for the benefit of all our users. Where we use your  information for anti-fraud purposes it arises from the conduct of an online transaction with us.  We limit our uses of data for anti-fraud purposes to those which are strictly necessary and  within our assessed legitimate interests to protect our customers and our services. For certain  online transactions we may also validate the information provided by you with publicly  accessible sources.   We may use your personal information, including date of birth, to verify identity, assist with  identification of users, and to determine appropriate services. For example, we may use date of  birth to determine the age of Apple ID account holders.   From time to time, we may use your personal information to send important notices, such as  communications about purchases and changes to our terms, conditions, and policies. Because  this information is important to your interaction with Apple, you may not opt out of receiving  these communications.   We may also use personal information for internal purposes such as auditing, data analysis, and  research to improve Apple s products, services, and customer communications.   If you enter into a sweepstake, contest, or similar promotion we may use the information you  provide to administer those programs.   Source of your personal information where they are not collected from you   We may have received your personal information from other persons if that person has shared  their content with you using Apple products, sent gift certificates and products, or invited you to  participate in Apple services or forums. We may also validate the information provided by you  when creating an Apple ID with a third party for security and fraud prevention purposes.   For research and development purposes, we may use datasets such as those that contain images,  voices or other data that could be associated with an identifiable person. When acquiring such  datasets, we do so in accordance with applicable law in the jurisdiction in which the dataset is  hosted. When using such datasets for research and development, we do not attempt to re- identify individuals who may appear therein.

These technologies  help us better understand user behavior, tell us which parts of our websites people have visited,  and facilitate and measure the effectiveness of advertisements and web searches. We treat  information collected by cookies and other technologies as non-personal information. However,  to the extent that Internet Protocol (IP) addresses or similar identifiers are considered personal  information by local law, we also treat these identifiers as personal information. Similarly, to the  extent that non-personal information is combined with personal information, we treat the  combined information as personal information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.   Ads that are delivered by Apple s advertising platform may appear in Apple News and in the App  Store. If you do not wish to receive ads targeted to your interests from Apple's advertising  platform, you can choose to enable Limit Ad Tracking, which will opt your Apple ID out of receiving  such ads regardless of what device you are using. If you enable Limit AdTracking on your mobile  device, third-party apps cannot use the Advertising Identifier, a non-personal device identifier, to  serve you targeted ads. You may still see ads in the App Store or News based on context like your  search query or the channel you are reading. In third-party apps, you may see ads based on other  information.   https   www.apple.com in legal privacy en-ww cookies    Apple and our partners also use cookies and other technologies to remember personal  information when you use our website, online services, and applications. Our goal in these cases is  to make your experience with Apple more convenient and personal. For example, knowing your  first name lets us welcome you the next time you visit the Apple Online Store. Knowing your  country and language   and if you are an educator, your school   helps us provide a customized  and more useful shopping experience. Knowing someone using your computer or device has  shopped for a certain product or used a particular service helps us make our advertising and email  communications more relevant to your interests. And knowing your contact information,  hardware identifiers, and information about your computer or device helps us personalize your  operating system, set up your iCloud service, and provide you with better customer service.   If you want to disable cookies and you re using the Safari web browser, go to Safari preferences  and then to the privacy pane to manage your preferences. On your Apple mobile device, go to  Settings, then Safari, scroll down to the Privacy & Security section, and tap on  Block Cookies  to  manage your preferences. For other browsers, check with your provider to find out how to disable  cookies. Please note that certain features of the Apple website will not be available once cookies  are disabled.   As is true of most internet services, we gather some information automatically and store it in log  files. This information includes Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type and language,  Internet service provider (ISP), referring and exit websites and applications, operating system,  date time stamp, and clickstream data.   We use this information to understand and analyze trends, to administer the site, to learn about  user behavior on the site, to improve our product and services, and to gather demographic  information about our user base as a whole. Apple may use this information in our marketing and  advertising services.   In some of our email messages, we use a  click-through URL  linked to content on the Apple  website. When customers click one of these URLs, they pass through a separate web server  before arriving at the destination page on our website. We track this click-through data to help us  determine interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our customer  communications. If you prefer not to be tracked in this way, you should not click text or graphic  links in the email messages.   Pixel tags enable us to send email messages in a format customers can read, and they tell us  whether mail has been opened. We may use this information to reduce or eliminate messages  sent to customers.

[2019-04-04 05:42:17,920: WARNING/ForkPoolWorker-1] Cookies and Other Technologies   Apple s websites, online services, interactive applications, email messages, and advertisements  may use "cookies" and other technologies such as pixel tags and web beacons. These technologies  help us better understand user behavior, tell us which parts of our websites people have visited,  and facilitate and measure the effectiveness of advertisements and web searches. We treat  information collected by cookies and other technologies as non-personal information. However,  to the extent that Internet Protocol (IP) addresses or similar identifiers are considered personal  information by local law, we also treat these identifiers as personal information. Similarly, to the  extent that non-personal information is combined with personal information, we treat the  combined information as personal information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.   Ads that are delivered by Apple s advertising platform may appear in Apple News and in the App  Store. If you do not wish to receive ads targeted to your interests from Apple's advertising  platform, you can choose to enable Limit Ad Tracking, which will opt your Apple ID out of receiving  such ads regardless of what device you are using. If you enable Limit AdTracking on your mobile  device, third-party apps cannot use the Advertising Identifier, a non-personal device identifier, to  serve you targeted ads. You may still see ads in the App Store or News based on context like your  search query or the channel you are reading. In third-party apps, you may see ads based on other  information.   https   www.apple.com in legal privacy en-ww cookies    Apple and our partners also use cookies and other technologies to remember personal  information when you use our website, online services, and applications. Our goal in these cases is  to make your experience with Apple more convenient and personal. For example, knowing your  first name lets us welcome you the next time you visit the Apple Online Store. Knowing your  country and language   and if you are an educator, your school   helps us provide a customized  and more useful shopping experience. Knowing someone using your computer or device has  shopped for a certain product or used a particular service helps us make our advertising and email  communications more relevant to your interests. And knowing your contact information,  hardware identifiers, and information about your computer or device helps us personalize your  operating system, set up your iCloud service, and provide you with better customer service.   If you want to disable cookies and you re using the Safari web browser, go to Safari preferences  and then to the privacy pane to manage your preferences. On your Apple mobile device, go to  Settings, then Safari, scroll down to the Privacy & Security section, and tap on  Block Cookies  to  manage your preferences. For other browsers, check with your provider to find out how to disable  cookies. Please note that certain features of the Apple website will not be available once cookies  are disabled.   As is true of most internet services, we gather some information automatically and store it in log  files. This information includes Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type and language,  Internet service provider (ISP), referring and exit websites and applications, operating system,  date time stamp, and clickstream data.   We use this information to understand and analyze trends, to administer the site, to learn about  user behavior on the site, to improve our product and services, and to gather demographic  information about our user base as a whole. Apple may use this information in our marketing and  advertising services.   In some of our email messages, we use a  click-through URL  linked to content on the Apple  website. When customers click one of these URLs, they pass through a separate web server  before arriving at the destination page on our website. We track this click-through data to help us  determine interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our customer  communications. If you prefer not to be tracked in this way, you should not click text or graphic  links in the email messages.   Pixel tags enable us to send email messages in a format customers can read, and they tell us  whether mail has been opened. We may use this information to reduce or eliminate messages  sent to customers.

[2019-04-04 05:57:12,836: WARNING/ForkPoolWorker-4] Collection and Use of Personal Information   Personal information is data that can be used to identify or contact a single person.   You may be asked to provide your personal information anytime you are in contact with Apple or  an Apple affiliated company. Apple and its affiliates may share this personal information with each  other and use it consistent with this Privacy Policy. They may also combine it with other  information to provide and improve our products, services, content, and advertising. You are not  required to provide the personal information that we have requested, but, if you chose not to do  so, in many cases we will not be able to provide you with our products or services or respond to  any queries you may have.   Here are some examples of the types of personal information Apple may collect and how we may  use it    What personal information we collect   When you create an Apple ID, apply for commercial credit, purchase a product, download a  software update, register for a class at an Apple Retail Store, connect to our services, contact us  or participate in an online survey, we may collect a variety of information, including your name,  mailing address, phone number, email address, contact preferences, device identifiers, IP  address, location information and credit card information.   When you share your content with family and friends using Apple products, send gift  certificates and products, or invite others to participate in Apple services or forums, Apple may  collect the information you provide about those people such as name, mailing address, email  address, and phone number. Apple will use such information to fulfill your requests, provide  the relevant product or service, or for anti-fraud purposes.   In certain jurisdictions, we may ask for a government issued ID in limited circumstances  including when setting up a wireless account and activating your device, for the purpose of  extending commercial credit, managing reservations, or as required by law.   https   www.apple.com legal privacy    How we use your personal information   We may process your personal information  for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, with  your consent, for compliance with a legal obligation to which Apple is subject or when we have  assessed it is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by Apple or a third  party to whom it may be necessary to disclose information.   The personal information we collect allows us to keep you posted on Apple s latest product  announcements, software updates, and upcoming events. If you don t want to be on our  mailing list, you can opt out anytime by updating your preferences.   We also use personal information to help us create, develop, operate, deliver, and improve our  products, services, content and advertising, and for loss prevention and anti-fraud purposes.  We may also use your personal information for account and network security purposes,  including in order to protect our services for the benefit of all our users. Where we use your  information for anti-fraud purposes it arises from the conduct of an online transaction with us.  We limit our uses of data for anti-fraud purposes to those which are strictly necessary and  within our assessed legitimate interests to protect our customers and our services. For certain  online transactions we may also validate the information provided by you with publicly  accessible sources.   We may use your personal information, including date of birth, to verify identity, assist with  identification of users, and to determine appropriate services. For example, we may use date of  birth to determine the age of Apple ID account holders.   From time to time, we may use your personal information to send important notices, such as  communications about purchases and changes to our terms, conditions, and policies. Because  this information is important to your interaction with Apple, you may not opt out of receiving  these communications.   We may also use personal information for internal purposes such as auditing, data analysis, and  research to improve Apple s products, services, and customer communications.   If you enter into a sweepstake, contest, or similar promotion we may use the information you  provide to administer those programs.   Source of your personal information where they are not collected from you   We may have received your personal information from other persons if that person has shared  their content with you using Apple products, sent gift certificates and products, or invited you to  participate in Apple services or forums. We may also validate the information provided by you  when creating an Apple ID with a third party for security and fraud prevention purposes.   For research and development purposes, we may use datasets such as those that contain images,  voices or other data that could be associated with an identifiable person. When acquiring such  datasets, we do so in accordance with applicable law in the jurisdiction in which the dataset is  hosted. When using such datasets for research and development, we do not attempt to re- identify individuals who may appear therein.

These technologies  help us better understand user behavior, tell us which parts of our websites people have visited,  and facilitate and measure the effectiveness of advertisements and web searches. We treat  information collected by cookies and other technologies as non-personal information. However,  to the extent that Internet Protocol (IP) addresses or similar identifiers are considered personal  information by local law, we also treat these identifiers as personal information. Similarly, to the  extent that non-personal information is combined with personal information, we treat the  combined information as personal information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.   Ads that are delivered by Apple s advertising platform may appear in Apple News and in the App  Store. If you do not wish to receive ads targeted to your interests from Apple's advertising  platform, you can choose to enable Limit Ad Tracking, which will opt your Apple ID out of receiving  such ads regardless of what device you are using. If you enable Limit AdTracking on your mobile  device, third-party apps cannot use the Advertising Identifier, a non-personal device identifier, to  serve you targeted ads. You may still see ads in the App Store or News based on context like your  search query or the channel you are reading. In third-party apps, you may see ads based on other  information.   https   www.apple.com in legal privacy en-ww cookies    Apple and our partners also use cookies and other technologies to remember personal  information when you use our website, online services, and applications. Our goal in these cases is  to make your experience with Apple more convenient and personal. For example, knowing your  first name lets us welcome you the next time you visit the Apple Online Store. Knowing your  country and language   and if you are an educator, your school   helps us provide a customized  and more useful shopping experience. Knowing someone using your computer or device has  shopped for a certain product or used a particular service helps us make our advertising and email  communications more relevant to your interests.

For other browsers, check with your provider to find out how to disable  cookies. Please note that certain features of the Apple website will not be available once cookies  are disabled.   As is true of most internet services, we gather some information automatically and store it in log  files. This information includes Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type and language,  Internet service provider (ISP), referring and exit websites and applications, operating system,  date time stamp, and clickstream data.   We use this information to understand and analyze trends, to administer the site, to learn about  user behavior on the site, to improve our product and services, and to gather demographic  information about our user base as a whole. Apple may use this information in our marketing and  advertising services.   In some of our email messages, we use a  click-through URL  linked to content on the Apple  website. When customers click one of these URLs, they pass through a separate web server  before arriving at the destination page on our website.
